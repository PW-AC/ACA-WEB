The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive replica of , progressing from a basic UI to a feature-rich MVP. Initial steps involved thorough analysis of the original website's design and structure using  and . The development followed a frontend-first approach with mocked data, creating core components like Hero, Process, Solutions, Customer Segments, Header, Footer, About, and Contact pages. Content from an uploaded  was then strategically integrated, followed by strict 1:1 implementation of the Privacy Policy and Imprint pages. The AI proactively performed visual optimizations, including adding animations and addressing layout issues for a fixed header. A user-provided video was seamlessly integrated into the homepage. Most recently, a new Pflichten des Arbeitgebers page was researched, created, and integrated into the navigation. The AI engineer demonstrated a strong ability to adhere to detailed design guidelines, manage file creation/edits, and debug issues (e.g., lint errors in ). The current state involves the integration of a new Business Benefits Section, which was the immediate task.

The user initially requested a beautiful copy of , including all buttons and their corresponding pages, adapted to a new design. This involved replicating the UI/UX, multi-page structure, and interactive elements. Key design elements identified were a dark blue/navy background with geometric patterns, orange accent colors for CTAs, a clean professional layout, a three-step process flow, and customer segment cards.

After the initial frontend build with mocked data, the user provided a  document, requesting its content be sensibly and visually appealingly integrated onto the website, focusing on information important for foreign employers regarding occupational pension schemes (bAV).

Subsequent explicit requests included:
1.  **Button and Functionality Replication**: Implement all buttons and their functions from the original website, ensuring clicks lead to respective pages in the new design. This led to the creation of Privacy Policy and Imprint pages.
2.  **Video Integration**: Embed a user-uploaded video () onto the homepage.
3.  **Color Palette Adjustment**: User noted the chosen orange color palette did not match the original website and requested adjustment.
4.  **Pflichten des Arbeitgebers Page**: Add a new navigation tab and page titled Pflichten des Arbeitgebers (Employer Obligations), informing visitors about legal obligations for employers in Germany regarding occupational pension schemes (Entgeltumwandlung, Direktversicherung) and how Acencia can alleviate this burden, ensuring content is legally correct via research and visually appealing.
5.  **Strict Content Replication**: Ensure the Datenschutzerklärung (Privacy Policy) and Impressum (Imprint) pages contain *exactly* the provided text, 1:1, without any deviation.
6.  **Content Gap Analysis & Implementation**: After the AI identified missing content (Business Benefits, Service Descriptions, Cost-Neutral Model, Partner Login) from the original site, the user requested to implement all of the suggested improvements, then narrowed it down to only 1 (Business Benefits Section).
