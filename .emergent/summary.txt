The previous AI engineer meticulously developed and refined the  application, transitioning it from a basic MVP to a feature-rich, visually consistent platform. The work was highly iterative, responding to detailed user feedback across various UI/UX aspects, content integration, and structural modifications. Key developments included a comprehensive redesign of multiple pages (Homepage, bAV, Aktuelles, About, Contact), implementing dynamic and expandable content, ensuring consistent branding with corporate colors and geometric patterns, and integrating a backend email service.

Subsequent efforts focused on significant architectural and content restructuring. This involved global font changes to Open Sans, a major overhaul of navigation with nested dropdowns and new placeholder pages for bKV and bUV, and a complete re-organization of homepage content, transferring elements to a new bAV page while introducing a new, simpler Home page. The engineer also refined content on specific pages, updated legal disclaimers, and created a Service-Team page with placeholders. The latest request is a complete architectural simplification, aiming for a single Python application without a database, preparing for deployment on Render.com.

<product_requirements>
The overarching product goal is to replicate  with a modern, consistent design, enhanced interactivity, and a strong brand identity, primarily using the corporate color .

**Key Feature and Page Requirements:**
- **Homepage**: Evolved from a complex layout to a simplified entry point, initially with a compact 3-step process and tab-based benefits, then refined to introduce Our Customers Trust Us and a 30+ years of expertise message. It underwent a major restructuring to become a clean landing page with a clear value proposition, removing detailed sections.
- **bAV (formerly bAV - rechtliche Grundlagen / Pflichten des Arbeitgebers)**: Completely overhauled for structure, spacing, and transitions, later containing the former homepage's core content (Hero, 3-step process) alongside its own definition, legal disclaimers, and challenge/solution sections. It also gained sub-pages for Für Unternehmen and Für Arbeitnehmer.
- **Aktuelles Page**: Redesigned for a 3x3 responsive grid, adapted to blue corporate colors, and later integrated as a sub-item under the bAV navigation.
- **Über uns Page**: Made compact, adapted to blue corporate colors, increased  dominance, and now features a Service-Team sub-page with employee placeholders.
- **Contact Page**: Integrated with a backend email service, increased  dominance, and now has a Beratung sub-page.
- **Der Service Page**: Removed.
- **Global UI/UX**:
    - **Design Consistency**: Uniform font/box sizes, smooth transitions, pervasive  blue, and animated geometric background patterns.
    - **Typography**: Global adoption of Open Sans font.
    - **Navigation**: Dynamic, nested dropdown menus across all main navigation items (bAV, bKV, bUV, über uns, Kontakt), with specific naming conventions (e.g., die bAV to bAV, Über uns to über uns) and removal of Leere Vorlage.
    - **Interactivity**: Expanded content sections, click-to-scroll functionality for specific content areas.
- **New Product Pages**: Placeholder pages for bKV and bUV with their respective sub-pages (X, Y).
- **Architectural Simplification (Future Goal)**: Refactor to a single Python application serving the frontend, without a database, and remove lock files for easier deployment on services like Render.com.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a significant phase of feature development and content restructuring for the  application. The website now features a completely revamped navigation system, a new minimalist Home landing page, and a re-organized bAV page that consolidates previously disparate content with specific bAV information. Placeholder pages and dropdown menus for new product categories (bKV, bUV) and an Über uns sub-page (Service-Team) are also in place.

The most recent user request (Chat Message 372) is a fundamental shift in the project's direction, moving from feature development to a complete architectural refactoring. The user explicitly requested to:
1.  **Analyze and clean the entire codebase**: Remove error-prone or unnecessarily complex structures.
2.  **Optimize architecture**: For better readability and maintainability.
3.  **Consolidate frontend and backend**: The backend (Python FastAPI) should also provide the frontend (React application) within a *single Python application*.
4.  **Remove database dependency**: The application should function *without a database*. This implies removing MongoDB integration.
5.  **Prepare for hosting**: Specifically targeting services like Render.com, which support single Python applications.
6.  **Eliminate lock files**: Ensure  or  are neither used nor needed.

The AI engineer has acknowledged this as a major restructuring and stated that they will approach it systematically. No code changes have been made yet regarding this new architectural task; the engineer was in the planning/analysis phase.
