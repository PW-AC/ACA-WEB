<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to replicate  with a new, consistent design and enhanced interactive elements. The application now features core pages (About, Contact, Privacy, Imprint, Aktuelles). Key requirements fulfilled include:
1.  **Homepage Restructuring**: The homepage was reorganized to remove old sections, integrate a new 3-step process section (initially horizontal, then expandable), and replace an InteractiveMainSections component with a tab-based Vorteile section (Unternehmen/Mitarbeitende) that consolidates and expands on existing benefits.
2.  **Pflichten des Arbeitgebers Page Redesign**: Renamed to bAV - rechtliche Grundlagen, this page was completely revamped based on a user-provided image, adopting the Hero section's dark background and animations. It now includes Pflichten vs. Chancen sections with legal text links, and its introductory sections were made significantly more compact. The legal notice was integrated directly into the Hero section.
3.  **Dynamic Backgrounds**: A subtle, animated background design, consistent with the Hero section's geometric forms and animated points, was applied to all white sections across the site.
4.  **Aktuelles Page**: Adapted to the Hero's blue company colors, it now includes a new external article (categorized as Expertenmeinung) and makes all articles clickable to their original sources.
5.  **Über uns Page**: Made significantly more compact and adapted to the Hero's blue company colors.
6.  **Der Service Page Removal**: This entire page and its references were removed from the application.
7.  **Button Removal**: All Demo buchen buttons were removed throughout the application.
