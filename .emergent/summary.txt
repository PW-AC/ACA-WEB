The previous AI engineer demonstrated strong iterative development and responsiveness to user feedback, primarily focusing on extensive UI/UX refinements and content organization. Initially tasked with architectural simplification (single Python app, no database, no lock files), this core request was explicitly paused by the user. The subsequent trajectory became a deep dive into frontend design, encompassing detailed changes to the navigation bar (from simple icons to complex SVG cards, then back to simpler text), homepage content (removal, compaction), footer elements (LinkedIn, YouTube integration), and the introduction of dynamic components like the Google Reviews section with custom animations. The engineer successfully handled numerous granular requests, adapting existing components and introducing new ones while maintaining a consistent brand aesthetic and responsiveness. The current state reflects a highly polished frontend, with the architectural refactoring pending.

The goal is to modernize  with a consistent, interactive design, emphasizing the corporate  color. Initially, the project aimed for a complete architectural refactor into a single Python application without a database, preparing for Render.com deployment, and removing lock files. This was paused.

Subsequent requirements focused on UI/UX:
- **Navigation**: Dynamic icons (initially small, then large SVG cards, finally compact text links), nested dropdowns, specific naming, repositioning of elements (logo, Login, Support, über uns), and ensuring zero horizontal space for dropdown arrows.
- **Homepage**: Simplified layout, removal of introductory texts (Über 30 Jahre Expertise, Willkommen bei ACENCIA), significant compaction of sections (Hero, Key Message, Expertise Cards, Customer Segments), and integration of a new, animated Google Reviews section with 4.9-star ratings and continuous scrolling.
- **Wir begleiten Sie... section**: Expandable content boxes with larger, bolder arrows, and removal of a mehr über Herausforderungen erfahren button.
- **Footer**: Integration of LinkedIn and YouTube buttons with specific styling and links, and text modification.
- **Buttons**: Removal of non-orange button from Unsicher, welche Lösung..., and text/link change for the remaining button.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a significant phase of UI/UX improvements. The latest sequence of tasks involved:
1.  **Reverting Navigation to Text**: The large SVG card-based navigation for bAV, bKV, bUV was replaced with simple text links (e.g., bAV, bKV, bUV).
2.  **Compacting Navigation Bar**: The overall height of the navigation bar was reduced from  to .
3.  **Restructuring Right-Side Navigation**: The Login Portal (orange button) and the Support link were repositioned to the far right, with the Support link now appearing vertically below the Login Portal button, and styled to be smaller.
These changes were applied to both desktop and mobile navigation. The goal was to achieve a more compact, streamlined, and professional-looking navigation bar with clear text labels, ensuring more space for the page content. The AI confirmed the successful implementation and visual consistency via screenshots.
