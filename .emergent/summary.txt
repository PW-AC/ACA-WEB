The previous AI engineer's work focused primarily on a comprehensive, iterative Apple-like UI/UX redesign of the  application. Initially, this involved extensive refinement of the homepage components: Header, Hero Section, CustomerSegments, GoogleReviews, and Footer. User feedback played a critical role, leading to immediate corrections, such as restoring the dynamic scrolling for Google Reviews and refining the Footer's aesthetic. Subsequently, the task shifted to a systematic, page-by-page application of these design guidelines across all main and subpages (bAV, bKV, bUV, Imprint, Privacy, About, Contact, Service Team, Employer Obligations). This process included significant content refactoring, re-integrating original content, and resolving technical issues like routing errors after file deletions. The work highlights a strong emphasis on consistent typography, grid systems, spacing, and a clean, professional visual identity. The latest directives involve further optimizing homepage content by removing redundant elements and migrating sections to other pages.

The overarching goal is to modernize  with a consistent, interactive, and professional Apple-like design, emphasizing the corporate  color. Architectural refactoring was initially requested but paused. Key UI/UX requirements included:

- **Homepage:** Clean layout, Digital. Einfach. Modern. as the core message, an interactive Hero Section, refined service boxes (bAV, bKV, bUV), custom benefit icons, and a continuously scrolling Google Reviews section. Explicitly requested removal of badge-boxes.

Content presentation should be streamlined, with clear hierarchy (H1->H2->H3) and lists.
